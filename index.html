        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <ol style="font-size: 15px">
            <li>My name is Callie Samton. I'm a junior majoring in Film & Media Studies with a minor in Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I'm interested in the intersection of tech and design but haven't done much work in either, so this class seems like a good place to start!</li>
            <br>
            <li>I have absolutely no experience with HTML/CSS/JS, but I'm really excited to learn some of the foundations.</li>
            <br>
            <li>During this course, I'm hoping to gain baseline knowledge and skills that can help me design websites efficiently and aesthetically.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Compared to print, designing for a screen requires greater consideration of the "user experience." While print design is confined to staticity, web design has the ability to be much more interactive.</li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="https://www.ogilvy.com/">This site</a> exemplifies effective design. It's simple yet dynamic, with attention-grabbing bold fonts and colors that gradually fade to highlight the site's actual purpose.</li> 
            <br>
            <li><a href="https://milkbarstore.com">This site</a> exemplifies effective communication. The navigation is simple and straightforward, and the product is made obvious to the user.   </li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com">This site</a> works well. The homepage is easy to navigate and clearly displays all of the most important elements, while the professional yet playful design is reflective of the company.</li>
       </ol>
